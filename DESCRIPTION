Description: This package provides two approaches to formally test for pleiotropy
    with a single SNP (pleiotropySNP) or a region (pleiotropyGENE). These
    approaches depend on permuting the phenotypes of interest and
    comparing the set of observed p-values to the set of permuted p-values
    in relation to the origin (e.g. a vector of zeros) either using the
    Hausdorff metric or a cut-off based approach.
